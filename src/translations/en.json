      "subtitle": "Bachelor Thesis – HTW Berlin (2025)",
      "description": "This project presents the design, implementation, and testing of a modular snake-like robot inspired by biological snake locomotion. It reproduces lateral undulation and sidewinding using a Central Pattern Generator (CPG) control model, built entirely from scratch for the thesis 'Neurobiologically-inspired Control of a Robot.' The robot integrates mechanical engineering, embedded programming, and motion neuroscience into a functional bio-inspired system.",
      "features": [
        "✅ **Mechanical Design**: Built in Onshape CAD and 3D-printed with TPU friction scales and PLA+ wheels. Alternating servo layout (horizontal/vertical) for complex out-of-plane motion.",
        "✅ **Control System**: CPG control based on a phase-coupled oscillator model. Implements two gaits – lateral undulation and sidewinding – driven by sinusoidal position updates at 50Hz.",
        "✅ **Microcontroller & Power**: ESP32 used for real-time web-based control and Wi-Fi AP mode. Each of the 10 servo segments includes a local buck converter with capacitive filtering for noise suppression.",
        "✅ **Web Interface**: Developed in React.js and served over Wi-Fi from ESP32. Allows live tuning of motion parameters (amplitude, frequency, phase offset) and toggling of movement direction.",
        "✅ **Testing & Evaluation**: Experimental trials conducted on laminate flooring. Multiple configurations (base, TPU scales, PLA+ wheels) were compared using video tracking and current sensors.",
        "✅ **Motion Tracking**: Kinovea used to track head/tail motion. Data exported to CSV and visualized in React-based plots, showing performance differences across configurations and gaits.",
        "✅ **Energy Profiling**: Current draw was measured using ACS712 sensor. Sidewinding was found to consume ~50% more current than lateral undulation, with PLA+ wheels offering the most consistent performance.",
        "✅ **Robust Control Architecture**: Uses mathematical oscillator model (θk = A·cos(2πft + φk)) for each servo. Oscillator phase relationships enable direction control and motion symmetry.",
        "✅ **Design Evolution**: Replaced an earlier STM32 version with ESP32 for better connectivity and real-time tuning. Power distribution was redesigned for servo isolation, and mechanical tolerances were iteratively improved.",
        "✅ **Future Work**: The thesis proposes improvements like ESP-NOW-based swarm collaboration, autonomous direction control using IMUs, and flexible soft-body actuation for terrain adaptation."
